I am a third-year math Ph.D. student at Brown University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Isabel Vogt](https://www.math.brown.edu/ivogt/).

Additionally, I like using my math and CS background in studying generative modeling, and am also currently doing research in the [PALM AI lab](https://chensun.me). 

Earlier, I studied mathematics and computer science at Grinnell College, Iowa, advised by [Prof. Jennifer Paulhus](https://paulhus.math.grinnell.edu/index.html) and [Prof. Nicole Eikmeier](https://eikmeier.sites.grinnell.edu). I also spent my senior year in the Budapest Semesters in Math program, and I highly recommend it.

My publications and preprints can be found [here](https://dakshces.github.io/publications/). My email address is [first\_name]\_[last\_name]@brown.edu.
